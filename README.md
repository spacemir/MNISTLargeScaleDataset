# MNISTLargeScale-dataset
The MNISTLargeScale dataset is a variation of the standard MNIST dataset of handwritten digits
with large scale variations (a factor 16). The dataset was introduced in 

[1] Y. Jansson and T. Lindeberg (2020) “Exploring the ability of CNNs to generalise to previously unseen scales”, arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.01536.

and is derived from the original MNIST dataset

The dataset is freely available at DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3820247. 

We here provide, for convenience, Matlab and Python scripts for reading the dataset and plotting some images.
See DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3820247 and [1] for additional information about the dataset and benchmark results.
